# Awesome Agent Cortex [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> The sovereign agent stack — practical scripts, on-chain identity, and
> knowledge graphs for AI agents that think, remember, and own themselves.

A curated list covering the full AI agent ecosystem: frameworks, coding agents,
MCP tooling, knowledge graphs, blockchain identity, decentralized finance
agents, quantitative trading, and observability. What makes this list unique is
the combination of practical developer tooling with on-chain identity and memory
infrastructure — resources no other awesome list brings together.

Note: Some resources are intentionally listed in multiple sections when they are
core to more than one workflow domain (for example, prompt + eval, or coding +
CLI usage).
